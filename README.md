Version 1.0 of a Random Magic Item Generator. I made this with Dungeons & Dragons in mind, but I expect it will work for other TTRPGs too. It's meant to be used as inspiration for creating your own magic items, rather than creating them for you. The results vary in quality, but a lot of the time they are quite silly. 

I sourced data for this project from the following:
